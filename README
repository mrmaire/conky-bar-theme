Simple Bar Conky Theme by mrmaire [maire.nunez@gmail.com]
A minimalist theme for conky

I've tested this running an up-to-date Majanro Linux 64bit installation, but I do not know if it works in other distributions.

Installation steps:
====================
1) Put the conkyrc in you ~/.conky folder o install through conky-manager.
2) Make sure your conky version stupport lua and nvidia (Arch and Manjaro: conky-lua-nv)
3) Make sure you've got all the dependencies (hddtemp ...) and they are running (also on startup)
4) Make sure you've installed the fonts in /fonts
5) Edit the system specific setting, for example your wifi/eth interface

Enjoy!
